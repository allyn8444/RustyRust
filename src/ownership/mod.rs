/*
=== EXPLANATION ====

Why &str Works but Not String:

- &str is a reference to a statically allocated string, and it implements the Copy trait.
- Copying a &str simply involves duplicating the pointer and length, which is cheap.

- String is a heap-allocated, owned type, and moving it requires transferring ownership.
- Since Rust enforces strict ownership rules, this causes problems if you try to use the original variable (x) after the move.



Summary
- Use &str when you donâ€™t need ownership of the string and can work with a reference.
- Use String when you need an owned, mutable string.
- If you want to copy a tuple containing a String, you must explicitly clone, .clone(), the String to avoid ownership issues.

// ---------- Mutability ---------- //


fn own6() {

    // make the necessary variable mutable
    let s = String::from("Hello ");
    
    let mut s1 = s; // put mut keyword

    s1.push_str("World!"); // you can't do this to &str as they're immutable 

    println!("{}", s1);
}


fn own7() {
    let x = Box::new(5);       // Allocate an integer (5) on the heap and bind it to x
    // 5 is i32 type that is stored in Stack Memory (static)
    // when Box is used, 5 i32 will be moved into Heap Memory making it dynamic 

    let mut y = Box::new(1);   // Allocate a separate integer (1) on the heap and bind it to y
    
    *y = 4;                    // Dereference y and assign the value 4 to the heap location
    
    assert_eq!(*x, 5);         // Assert that x's value is still 5 (unchanged)
    
    println!("Success!");      // Print "Success!" if the program runs without issues
}



// ---------- Partial Move ---------- //

// very complex example for now
fn partial_move_example() {
    
    #[derive(Debug)]
    struct Person {
        name: String,
        age: Box<u8>,
    }

    let person = Person {
        name: String::from("Alice"),
        age: Box::new(20),
    };

    // `name` is moved out of person, but `age` is referenced
    let Person { name, ref age } = person;

    println!("The person's age is {}", age);

    println!("The person's name is {}", name);

    // Error! borrow of partially moved value: `person` partial move occurs
    //println!("The person struct is {:?}", person);

    // `person` cannot be used but `person.age` can be used as it is not moved
    println!("The person's age from person struct is {}", person.age);
}




fn own8() {
   let t = (String::from("hello"), String::from("world"));

   let _s = t.0; // assign the first value of tuple in _s
   // Now, the ownership of t.0 is assigned to _s

   // Modify this line only, don't use `_s`
   println!("{:?}", t.1); // we can still access t.1 since it is only t.0 ownership's that has been transferred 
}


fn own9() {
   let t = (String::from("hello"), String::from("world"));

    // Fill the blanks
    let (s1, s2) = t.clone();
    // clone t first using .clone() method so that you can access t later
    // and then destructure

    println!("{:?}, {:?}, {:?}", s1, s2, t); // -> "hello", "world", ("hello", "world")
